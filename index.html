                        I learned I was passionate about coding when my Excel project turned into a 
                        VBA project that kept growing beyond my original ideas that I had set for it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="last-p" id="intro-p-2">
                        I had no prior training at all when I tried to fix a script that was supposed
                        to take all the cells of a certain color and add them together. None of 
                        the tutorials I found helped me much, I guess they gave me a faded dirt path I could 
                        follow but that was about it. I was jumping into something that was much bigger than 
                        I could have imagined at the time and there were so many questions that I needed answered
                        that I didn't know needed asking. I wasn't able to fix the script as I 
                        thought I could so easily do, and without realizing it, I stepped onto a road that will never end.

                                        Python was the second programming language I learned and introduced me to so many new concepts that
                                        I got pretty overwhelmed at first. I learned that I needed to prioritize using built-ins over my own
                                        solutions, which actually kinda disappointed me at first and it feel like I was cheating. The fact that
                                        I didn't need to declare variables really confused me, as did the fact that I could just write
                                        all my code onto the module without putting it into a function. I was lost as to what 
                                        I could do for a project and how to do it. VBA had made those things very easy for me in the past, you
                                        take data from the excel sheet, you work on it, you put your results on the excel sheet. Done. Simple.
                                        I did not have a place to collect that data from with Python so I had to figure out how to build one,
                                        so I learned how to use Tkinter. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Working at my previous job I was trying to put my newfound programming skills to use 
                                        in automating the tedious work we often had to do. When new work orders would pop up on our radar, we
                                        had to manually get the information on the cable we needed to cut from our inventory system, so 
                                        that we could split the work onto different people. I would sit there and copy and past each individual
                                        part number, run length and work order number onto an excel sheet, it would often take me at least 
                                        30 minutes to do. I automated this with Python, using Tkinter for my GUI and openpyxl to read the 
                                        excel file I downloaded from our inventory system. This was before I discovered pandas, so I used 
                                        openpyxl to get all the cell data from the worksheet and display everything relevant on the GUI.
                                        The desired content could be selected and saved to preset so that in the future; the user can see what
                                        they are looking for and add to the preset easily if needed. By just hitting the next button, the app 
                                        would then bring the user to the next page were they could then create an excel worksheet with with 
                                        a some options as to how the contents of that excel sheet would be arrayed. It divided the contents
                                        In a way so that it not only more readable for the worker, but also in steps so that the certain work
                                        could be completed in que. I found a much better way of doing this later with VBA on a shared workbook
                                        but this saved us a lot of time.

                                        When I learned that I would be moved into a position that required me to do reports on our inventory
                                        data at work, I started to build an app that automated those reports. It would scan for excel files,
                                        read them and determine what type of data they contained, then saved them in memory as an instance 
                                        of the class that they were associated with. Each one of these DataFile classes had a another class
                                        it was correlated to for processing that data. I kept these classes separate because I wanted a
                                        desired data file to do the report on and some reports required multiple data files, it also simplified
                                        the process on the command line. You would just need to type in the type of report you wanted to do; 
                                        which was a class, and then it would initialize an object with a data-frame inside it and some 
                                        methods for further processing that data-frame. It needed this simplification because some of these
                                        reports needed multiple reports themselves and it would leave room for error if I forgot which reports
                                        I needed to for my main report.

                                        My first program in VBA was all crammed into a single sub-procedure (function that returns no value), with several
                                        hundred lines of code, It shouldn't surprise you that I had created some cryptic nightmare. When I had finally
                                        clawed my way out of debugging hell and managed to get my program to work, it made me feel like some kind 
                                        of master architect, I had built something complex and understood how it worked.
                                    </p>

                                        I didn't learn VBA to get into programming, I learned it so that I could automate something that I wanted to automate.
                                        I wanted a system that could simplify our wire cutting process so that I didn't have to plan it out every time.
                                        If you had a spool with 3000 feet of wire on it, and you need 4440 feet of that wire, divided into multiple 
                                        cuts of 360, 180, 150, and 720, how do you get the most out of what you have? What combination results in the most
                                        waste (low length cuts are scrapped)? What combination results in the most amount of work orders fulfilled and does it
                                        fulfill the prioritized work orders? To even begin at answering at answering these questions I needed every possible
                                        combination of the requested run lengths.
                                    </p>

                                        Building the combinations algorithm that I needed may have been the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
                                        I had only just recently figured out how to use arrays and still knew very little about the tools I had
                                        at my disposal. Making that thing work became the obsession that pulled me into the world of programming. I 
                                        would sit it my chair looking up at the ceiling for hours running different patterns through my head until 
                                        I could make sense of one that work. After I had a pattern, It was a matter of implementing it programmatically.
                                        And that was hard considering how little I knew at the time.    
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="last-p">
                                        After I had finished the combinations algorithm, it still wasn't done, I noticed it was slow. And it was slow because
                                        I was feeding it too much data. I needed to eliminate much of that data earlier in the process, I needed to optimize 
                                        the algorithm so that it didn't produce duplicates. Everything I built in that project led to something else I needed
                                        to build, and it ended up growing into something much larger than I ever thought it would. When I got the main 
                                        process of the project completed: comparing and analyzing the best result. I wanted setting the user could adjust, 
                                        I wanted the results to be displayed in a readable way, and I wanted them to be adjustable. These things 
                                        complicated my project enormously, and I never finished it because for a few different reasons: one was because
                                        it became something that was not practical: no one was likely to use something so complex and disconnected with the
                                        current way of doing things. I also felt like at had a knack for this stuff and wanted to learn more about it, so
                                        I started learning Python.

                                        training the new staff of that facility. I was often looked to for guidance and I was on several occasions flown out to our other markets

                                        I'm always coming up with new ideas and many of these ideas are solutions to problems I've had to deal with.
                                        At my previous job, many of the different procedures we followed were my invention. The quality control process was a lot
                                        like dumpster diving when I first started working there, so I changed that to something better. instead of reaching into the 
                                        construction site kit and checking for each item on the list, I took everything out, sorted it and reviewed it. 
                                        I then told all the order pickers to organize the materials they were picking in a way so that only some of the light weight 
                                        items needed to be taken out and counted.

                                        Some of the cable we needed to cut was very large and heavy and needed to be put onto a spool. When we started running out of
                                        spools I figured out that each cut of this heavy cable was divided into 3 to 6 runs. I asked around and was able to get access 
                                        to the construction site build plans and use them to determine what the footage of each run was so that we could coil the cable 
                                        into smaller bundles.

                                        Getting corrugated conduit was always difficult, you had to roll the giant aluminum spool it was on across the warehouse, 
                                        de-spooling the conduit onto the ground. Then you had to measure it and roll up into a bundle. rolling it into a bundle 
                                        a lot of sweaty work and it just turned into a giant blob when you were done. To make this a lot easier I took one of the
                                        conduit spools and cut off one side with a reciprocating saw so that the conduit could be reeled onto it and then be 
                                        slid off.

                                        I would take these cardboard lids we had for gaylord boxes that were not in our warehouse anymore and cut pieces out of 
                                        them to make dividers for our plastic bins. With those dividers we could store different items into our plastic bins, and that
                                        helped a bit with how well we could consolidate things. I took cardboard and separated boxes of metal clamps into layers with
                                        25 pieces per layer so that way it would only take a second to count.

                                        I've always had problems losing things or just having a hard time finding them, so I really like to set things 
                                        up In a way that has some order to it. I spent all the down time I had at my previous job organizing the place,
                                        no one told me to do it, I just didn't like the fact that it was such a mess and nothing was were it was supposed to be.
                                        I spent a whole week digging through a pile of wire that spanned the size of a few cars, pulling out each bundle of wire, labeling it,
                                        and putting it on pallet with its same type.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There were always these three things I had to think about when I was organizing: accessability, consolidation and 
                                        how well things could be found. They all conflicted with each other most of the time; if you consolidated everything as 
                                        much as you possibly could, for example, you would have to bury many of those items behind other items making them
                                        unaccessible, and more difficult to find. Finding a balance between these things was always a challenge and it 
                                        was very satisfying to get it right. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As I organized more and more, the work kept getting easier and we kept getting done with our main line of work
                                        faster, which meant I had more time to organize. At one point almost every pallet in that warehouse was placed where it 
                                        was by me and for a specific reason.
                                    </p>

                                        About a year of being with that company they sent me to help out at one of their other markets up in Des Moines, Iowa.
                                        While I was up there I took a lot of the different standards I held for our warehouse and applied them there, the
                                        effects were pretty drastic. I transformed that place from whatever it was before into an actual warehouse.

                                        I can't do with problems sometimes, but I can't do without them either. I've always had this problem 
                                        with my desire and ability to learn, for some reason, in conventional methods; like school and college or whatever,
                                        some part of my brain just doesn't care: I struggle find the motivation and energy I need to comprehend
                                        what is being said to me in class. This led to me accomplishing much less that what I could have if things
                                        were just a bit different.

                                        Most things I know in Programming have mostly been learned through my efforts at solving a problem. The process usually goes like this:
                                        I come up with something I want to do, I try to do it and it fails. I then research a solution and none of the solutions make any sense to me,
                                        I realize that they don't make any sense to me because they are a part of a much larger concept that I do not understand yet.
                                        So I begin to learn that concept to realize I still missing a few things I need to know, so I go and learn that stuff too.
