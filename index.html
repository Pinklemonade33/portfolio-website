                                    I consider this website to be my first real project with CSS, HTML and JS. I think CSS is pretty nice; 
                                    easy to learn, easy to use, easy to read. That being said, it does take a thorough understanding of 
                                    how some of its properties actually work if want to avoid some serious head scratching.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                    HTML is purely the creation of elements on a webpage, the order they come in,
                                    and their hierarchy. I honestly should have just paired it with CSS as one skill as it's kinda hard
                                    to do HTML without CSS and impossible to do CSS without HTML.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="skills-js text">

                                    I was actually getting kinda bored in my website building education, but then I got to JS
                                    and everything got much much more interesting.
                                    It feels a lot like Python to me, except a lot of its syntax is almost identical to C and nothing like
                                    Pythons syntax at all, I'm guessing its because I have so many built-ins at my disposal with it. 
                                    And maybe it's also because I can do the same thing with it I like to do with Python which is; 
                                    to see how many variables I can eliminate by just using function calls and condensing my code down. 
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="skills-python text">
                                <p>
                                    Python was the second programming language I learned and introduced me to so many new concepts that
                                    I got pretty overwhelmed at first. I learned that I needed to prioritize using built-ins over my own
                                    solutions, which actually kinda disappointed me at first and it feel like I was cheating. The fact that
                                    I didn't need to declare variables really confused me, as did the fact that I could just write
                                    all my code onto the module without putting it into a function. I was lost as to what 
                                    I could do for a project and how to do it. VBA had made those things very easy for me in the past, you
                                    take data from the excel sheet, you work on it, you put your results on the excel sheet. Done. Simple.
                                    I did not have a place to collect that data from with Python so I had to figure out how to build one,
                                    so I learned how to use Tkinter. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Working at my previous job I was trying to put my newfound programming skills to use 
                                    in automating the tedious work we often had to do. When new work orders would pop up on our radar, we
                                    had to manually get the information on the cable we needed to cut from our inventory system, so 
                                    that we could split the work onto different people. I would sit there and copy and past each individual
                                    part number, run length and work order number onto an excel sheet, it would often take me at least 
                                    30 minutes to do. I automated this with Python, using Tkinter for my GUI and openpyxl to read the 
                                    excel file I downloaded from our inventory system. This was before I discovered pandas, so I used 
                                    openpyxl to get all the cell data from the worksheet and display everything relevant on the GUI.
                                    The desired content could be selected and saved to preset so that in the future; the user can see what
                                    they are looking for and add to the preset easily if needed. By just hitting the next button, the app 
                                    would then bring the user to the next page were they could then create an excel worksheet with with 
                                    a some options as to how the contents of that excel sheet would be arrayed. It divided the contents
                                    In a way so that it not only more readable for the worker, but also in steps so that the certain work
                                    could be completed in que. I found a much better way of doing this later with VBA on a shared workbook
                                    but this saved us a lot of time.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When I learned that I would be moved into a position that required me to do reports on our inventory
                                    data at work, I started to build an app that automated those reports. It would scan for excel files,
                                    read them and determine what type of data they contained, then saved them in memory as an instance 
                                    of the class that they were associated with. Each one of these DataFile classes had a another class
                                    it was correlated to for processing that data. I kept these classes separate because I wanted a
                                    desired data file to do the report on and some reports required multiple data files, it also simplified
                                    the process on the command line. You would just need to type in the type of report you wanted to do; 
                                    which was a class, and then it would initialize an object with a data-frame inside it and some 
                                    methods for further processing that data-frame. It needed this simplification because some of these
                                    reports needed multiple reports themselves and it would leave room for error if I forgot which reports
                                    I needed to for my main report.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    My first program in VBA was all crammed into a single sub-procedure (function that returns no value), with several
                                    hundred lines of code, It shouldn't surprise you that I had created some cryptic nightmare. When I had finally
                                    clawed my way out of debugging hell and managed to get my program to work, it made me feel like some kind 
                                    of master architect, I had built something complex and understood how it worked.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I didn't learn VBA to get into programming, I learned it so that I could automate something that I wanted to automate.
                                    I wanted a system that could simplify our wire cutting process so that I didn't have to plan it out every time.
                                    If you had a spool with 3000 feet of wire on it, and you need 4440 feet of that wire, divided into multiple 
                                    cuts of 360, 180, 150, and 720, how do you get the most out of what you have? What combination results in the most
                                    waste (low length cuts are scrapped)? What combination results in the most amount of work orders fulfilled and does it
                                    fulfill the prioritized work orders? To even begin at answering at answering these questions I needed every possible
                                    combination of the requested run lengths.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Building the combinations algorithm that I needed may have been the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
                                    I had only just recently figured out how to use arrays and still knew very little about the tools I had
                                    at my disposal. Making that thing work became the obsession that pulled me into the world of programming. I 
                                    would sit it my chair looking up at the ceiling for hours running different patterns through my head until 
                                    I could make sense of one that work. After I had a pattern, It was a matter of implementing it programmatically.
                                    And that was hard considering how little I knew at the time.    
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After I had finished the combinations algorithm, it still wasn't done, I noticed it was slow. And it was slow because
                                    I was feeding it too much data. I needed to eliminate much of that data earlier in the process, I needed to optimize 
                                    the algorithm so that it didn't produce duplicates. Everything I built in that project led to something else I needed
                                    to build, and it ended up growing into something much larger than I ever thought it would. When I got the main 
                                    process of the project completed: comparing and analyzing the best result. I wanted setting the user could adjust, 
                                    I wanted the results to be displayed in a readable way, and I wanted them to be adjustable. These things 
                                    complicated my project enormously, and I never finished it because for a few different reasons: one was because
                                    it became something that was not practical: no one was likely to use something so complex and disconnected with the
                                    current way of doing things. I also felt like at had a knack for this stuff and wanted to learn more about it, so
                                    I started learning Python.
