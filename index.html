                        I started coding when excel lacked a feature that I wanted, which was to
                        sum every cell of a certain color. I found a VBA script that allowed me 
                        to do that, but it didn't work so I tried to fix it. I thought that
                        I could just learn a few technical things and it would be enough, but I didn't realize that 
                        I was jumping into something that was much bigger than 
                        I could have imagined and there were so many questions that I needed answered
                        that I didn't know needed asking. I wasn't able to fix the script as I 
                        thought I could so easily do, and without realizing it, I started walking down a road I'm still following
                        today and may still be on for the rest of my life.

                                        I consider this to be the first real website project I've done, I knew very little of web development before starting this,
                                        and although I think I've learned a lot, there is still so much I don't understand. But I guess when working at a very high level
                                        with a vast amount of resources at my disposal, its impossible to really understand everything. Or at least understand things past
                                        basic usage. A lot of the times I find myself having to push things through until they work as I don't have time to get a better understanding
                                        of them. This kinda bothers me, I really don't like to do things improperly or inefficiently. However, with each thing I build, I have better
                                        knowledge of what to expect and with that I am much more capable of planning out my future projects.

                                        I've made this website a real challenge for myself, while I took some inspiration of other peoples work, I've gone
                                        to great lengths for it to be different, and different is always hard. I noticed a lot of people tend to make simple 
                                        portfolios with little information about themselves, this works for those with universally recognized accomplishments
                                        and real world work experience, but I doubt it would work for me. I think its likely that those who would want to hire me are people who do this work themselves and if they are 
                                        actively looking for someone to hire onto their team, then they probably don't have time to read through the amount
                                        of information I believe I need to show.

                                        I needed to make this project simple and as minimal as possible on the surface, but I also needed to give it
                                        the same depth as all of my experiences with this line of work. At a glance it needs to be able to get someones
                                        attention, and It needs to feed that attention for as long as possible. These requirements were met with 
                                        scrollable containers, a lot of buttons and a projects section that could quickly demonstrate my work. I 
                                        divided the site into sections and each of those sections was designed to fit the entire screen no matter the 
                                        screen size, and that turned out to be a real challenge.

                                        Python was the second programming language I learned and introduced me to so many new concepts that
                                        I got pretty overwhelmed at first. I learned that I needed to prioritize using built-ins over my own
                                        solutions, which actually kinda disappointed me at first and it feel like I was cheating. The fact that
                                        I didn't need to declare variables really confused me, as did the fact that I could just write
                                        all my code onto the module without putting it into a function. I was lost as to what 
                                        I could do for a project and how to do it. VBA had made those things very easy for me in the past, you
                                        take data from the excel sheet, you work on it, you put your results on the excel sheet. Done. Simple.
                                        I did not have a place to collect that data from with Python so I had to figure out how to build one,
                                        so I learned how to use Tkinter. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Working at my previous job I was trying to put my newfound programming skills to use 
                                        in automating the tedious work we often had to do. When new work orders would pop up on our radar, we
                                        had to manually get the information on the cable we needed to cut from our inventory system, so 
                                        that we could split the work onto different people. I would sit there and copy and past each individual
                                        part number, run length and work order number onto an excel sheet, it would often take me at least 
                                        30 minutes to do. I automated this with Python, using Tkinter for my GUI and openpyxl to read the 
                                        excel file I downloaded from our inventory system. This was before I discovered pandas, so I used 
                                        openpyxl to get all the cell data from the worksheet and display everything relevant on the GUI.
                                        The desired content could be selected and saved to preset so that in the future; the user can see what
                                        they are looking for and add to the preset easily if needed. By just hitting the next button, the app 
                                        would then bring the user to the next page were they could then create an excel worksheet with 
                                        some options as to how the contents of that excel sheet would be arrayed. It divided the contents
                                        In a way so that it was not only more readable for the worker, but also in steps so that certain work
                                        could be completed in que. I found a much better way of doing this later with VBA on a shared workbook
                                        but this saved us a lot of time.

                                        When I learned that I would be moved into a position that required me to do reports on our inventory
                                        data at work, I started to build an app that automated those reports. It would scan for excel files,
                                        read them and determine what type of data they contained, then saved them in memory as an instance 
                                        of the class that they were associated with. Each one of these DataFile classes had a another class
                                        it was correlated to for processing that data. I kept these classes separate because I wanted a
                                        desired data file to do the report on and some reports required multiple data files, it also simplified
                                        the process on the command line. You would just need to type in the type of report you wanted to do; 
                                        which was a class, and then it would initialize an object with a data-frame inside it and some 
                                        methods for further processing that data-frame. It needed this simplification because some of these
                                        reports needed multiple reports themselves and it would leave room for error if I forgot which reports
                                        I needed to for my main report.

                                        My first program in VBA was all crammed into a single sub-procedure (function that returns no value), with several
                                        hundred lines of code, It shouldn't surprise you that I had created some cryptic nightmare. When I had finally
                                        clawed my way out of debugging hell and managed to get my program to work, it made me feel like some kind 
                                        of master architect, I had built something complex and understood how it worked.

                                    <p>
                                        I didn't learn VBA to get into programming, I learned it so that I could automate something that I wanted to automate.
                                        I wanted a system that could simplify our wire cutting process so that I didn't have to plan it out every time.
                                        If you had a spool with 3000 feet of wire on it, and you need 4440 feet of that wire, divided into multiple 
                                        cuts of 360, 180, 150, and 720, how do you get the most out of what you have? What combination results in the most
                                        waste (low length cuts are scrapped)? What combination results in the most amount of work orders fulfilled and does it
                                        fulfill the prioritized work orders? To even begin at answering at answering these questions I needed every possible
                                        combination of the requested run lengths.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Building the combinations algorithm that I needed may have been the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
                                        I had only just recently figured out how to use arrays and still knew very little about the tools I had
                                        at my disposal. Making that thing work became the obsession that pulled me into the world of programming. I 
                                        would sit it my chair looking up at the ceiling for hours running different patterns through my head until 
                                        I could make sense of one that work. After I had a pattern, It was a matter of implementing it programmatically.
                                        And that was hard considering how little I knew at the time.    
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="last-p">
                                        After I had finished the combinations algorithm, it still wasn't done, I noticed it was slow. And it was slow because
                                        I was feeding it too much data. I needed to eliminate much of that data earlier in the process, I needed to optimize 
                                        the algorithm so that it didn't produce duplicates. Everything I built in that project led to something else I needed
                                        to build, and it ended up growing into something much larger than I ever thought it would. When I got the main 
                                        process of the project completed: comparing and analyzing the best result. I wanted settings the user could adjust, 
                                        I wanted the results to be displayed in a readable way, and I wanted them to be adjustable. These things 
                                        complicated my project enormously, and were part of the reason why I never finished that project. But 
                                        the time I spent on it wasn't for nothing, failure creates the incentive to learn and with every failed 
                                        block of code I wrote I was given the chance to get better at programming, and with every failed project I'm 
                                        given the chance to get better at developing software.

                                        Its what happened with my Job as a warehouse guy for a telecom company. I had so much freedom and everyone was so nice that 
                                        I felt very driven to volunteer myself to do a lot more work than anyone was asked to do, as well as things above my pay grade.

                                        At work I've always opened myself to any role so that I can contribute to what is needed the most, and often the role 
                                        I took was one of the hardest and least desired. At my previous job I did quality control, as a QC I would dig through the
                                        materials the pickers would gather into a large tote, take the materials out and verify that the part numbers and quantities were
                                        correct. It was very inefficient when I took that job as no one really worked in support of each other. The pickers would just blindly throw
                                        the items they needed into the tote without trying to keep it organized, and that would add a lot more time onto QC than was necessary.
                                        I worked with them to lay things out in a way I could very quickly look through everything, and that made such a large impact that 
                                        I ended up with a lot of down time. I used that down time to organize the picking lanes so that the pickers could more easily find things.

                                        slowed down and when the pickers quit we didn't hire anyone else for awhile. In the time where we didn't have pickers it was me and two other
                                        guys that did the entire order fulfillment process. Because we were limited on manpower, we decided
                                        to skip the QC process so that I could handle the cable cutting process myself instead of everyone waiting their turn to get the cable
                                        that was needed for the work order that they were working on. We did this for about half a year until we hired a new picker, and after that
                                        I picked up QC again, but I kept cutting wire, as I often had extra time and didn't want to spend it sitting around.

                                        In the last year I had spent working for that company, we were reduced to a few guys including myself who knew how to run the 
                                        place, management knew very little about the work we did and upper management might as well of not known we even existed. 
                                        When I found out that we supposed to do about four times the amount of work that we had ever done before, I knew that we needed
                                        more people, and we needed them before we got busy. But management didn't seem to grasp the seriousness of this and I had to put a
                                        lot of pressure on them to see any results. While we were able to pick up some new people, it was not enough, and 
                                        it wasn't in my managers power to create new openings. Upper management took months after everything
                                        started to create those openings. It was in those months of waiting for relief, those months of absolute chaos and overwhelming stress 
                                        that work started to interfere with my life at home.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        When no one knows what to do and the work expectations are ridiculous, people quit and that only makes the situation even worse.
                                        I at the time had other ideas as to what I should be doing with my life and quitting was on my mind, I didn't benefit from that
                                        job, no one had offered me anything and it didn't seem to lead anywhere. I loved that job and I loved the people I worked with,
                                        but I believed it was no longer something that I needed. But as much as those thoughts came to me, I couldn't abandon my team, so I stayed
                                        and suffered through it. I began to work overtime, often twelve hour shifts and it was only because my manager was getting blamed
                                        for our failures and I felt that that was completely unjustified. She would stay in office very late and I decided on many days
                                        that I would stay with her and work until she told me to go home. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        From the start of that insane year to the end of it we only had two out of five of our management staff. A few months into the 
                                        chaos and we finally hired someone to fill one of the those roles along with one of our guys in the warehouse. Neither worked out 
                                        and it caused complications in actually filling those roles, I was offered a position as well, but because of those complications 
                                        that promotion was dragged on indefinitely. The idea of being a supervisor really put a lot of drive into me to adjust myself. 
                                        My main thing was initiative, I needed to be someone to go to every member of my team, and not them to me. I also needed to 
                                        learn how to delegate, which is hard in this day and age where work is getting more and more complicated and requires a variety 
                                        of different skills.

                                        At some point we finally got the amount of people we needed, not all them were of the quality that we needed and it was
                                        difficult to fill certain roles because of this. I played a part in training some of these people in cutting wire and quality control.
                                        I also was very present in advising them on how to handle many of the problems they would run into, this along with my competence 
                                        gave me a lot of their respect and I started to get very confident in telling people what to do. I was replaced as the QC and 
                                        went full time into cutting wire with the guy who would replace me, which he never entirely did. I would remain in control of wire
                                        cutting until the end, managing our wire cutter by supplying him with work and making decisions in difficult situations.

                                        We were not the only market in our company that was in trouble and we were far from the worst actually. We had a cross dock in Tulsa 
                                        Oklahoma that we used to extend the range of our warehouse in Saint Louis and we had a lot of problems with it, and it was 
                                        mostly because we never 
                                        properly trained the team we had down there. After we got our own stuff figured out and started catching up on our demands, 
                                        I was flown down there a few times to sort things out and train their lead on a few things. When I got back from my second trip 
                                        to Tulsa they flew me to Phoenix and some months later I went to Chicago. I'll always remember the time I spent in those places 
                                        and the people I met there, I really miss being given the opportunity to travel and wish I could do it again.

                                        At the end of the year, we learned that our warehouse would be closing and that we would be layed off if we do not want move to 
                                        another location or take a remote position. A month after learning that we began to pack up everything and transfer it to our other
                                        markets which were already overfilled with stuff. At the end of December 2022 they layed off most of the warehouse team and
                                        our management staff, it was me and five other guys, who alone, had to send out an almost full warehouse of equipment and materials.
                                        It was very hard thing for me to go through as I had developed a strong attachment to that place and the people that I worked with and
                                        that attachment grew even stronger in the past year. That place was like a second home to me and I had to show up every day and 
                                        contribute to its demise. My coworker said that it was like having your girlfriend break up with you and you still had to live 
                                        with her.

                                        Some time in early February was our last day, we didn't have anything to do really, everything was mostly shipped out and we 
                                        were just sitting around and getting ready to say goodbye. Its in those situations when you can really tell how close
                                        you are to other people when it gets hard to say goodbye because you know that you may never see them again. I learned a lot from working 
                                        at that warehouse, but the most important thing I've learned is that I can fit in somewhere.

                                        Creativity was vital in developing my projects, without it I would never have
                                        been able to come up with them in the first place. I'm very driven to find better ways 
                                        of doing things, most of my projects are actually things I felt that myself or others would benefit from 
                                        if they existed, so I set out to build them. 
                                    </p>

                                        When we build something that we have not built before, we often find our instructions written out on the internet by people who 
                                        have done something similar to what you are trying to do. When we try to build something that no one has built before,
                                        the only place you are going to find the instructions to that are in your head. How much lateral thinking you need to 
                                        do is a matter of how different your project is from whatever is most similar to it. 
                                        If you want to give people a better way of looking through data, thats going to create a lot 
                                        of problems for you to work on. Those problems are many of the times not static, they are often
                                        dynamic in the sense that there is no set way to deal with them, there could be hundreds or thousands 
                                        of different solutions for those problems, or maybe just a few, and your creativity affects how many of
                                        those solutions you can find.

                                        My struggle has never
                                        been to stand out, its always been in conforming enough so that others can understand me. As a programmer, most of 
                                        my effort is in making my work as readable as possible as I'm not always sure how people prefer things to be 
                                        done. I often find myself googling problems not because I don't know how to do them, but because I want to know 
                                        how other people would do them so that I can keep myself from drifting too far away with how I do things.

                                        I'm at my best when doing something new and everyone is still figuring everything out. When I got hired to 
                                        work in the warehouse at my old job, one of the reasons I loved that place so much was because of how 
                                        undeveloped everything was. It was poorly organized and the work process was weak, and since the leadership was
                                        very lax I was able to reorganize the warehouse and redefine our process over time. I love to improve things,
                                        especially when those improvements are very impactful and there are so many more improvements to be made. I think the
                                        fact that I am a creative person makes me feel that way and I would very much prefer to work at a place that 
                                        needs me to be myself.

                                        I've always had problems losing things or just having a hard time finding them, so I really like to set things 
                                        up In a way that has some order to it. I spent all the down time I had at my previous job organizing the place,
                                        no one told me to do it, I just didn't like the fact that it was such a mess and nothing was were it was supposed to be.
                                        I spent a whole week digging through a pile of wire that spanned the size of a few cars, pulling out each bundle, labeling it
                                        and putting it on pallet with its same type.

                                        There were always these three things I had to think about when I was organizing: accessability, consolidation and 
                                        how well things could be found. They all conflicted with each other most of the time; if you consolidated everything as 
                                        much as you possibly could, for example, you would have to bury many of those items behind other items making them
                                        unaccessible, and more difficult to find. Finding a balance between these things was always a challenge and it 
                                        was very satisfying to get it right.

                                        As I organized more and more, the work kept getting easier and we kept getting done with our main line of work
                                        faster, which meant I had more time to organize. At one point almost every pallet in that warehouse was placed where it 
                                        was by me and for a specific reason.

                                        About a year of being with that company they sent me to help out at one of their other markets up in Des Moines, Iowa.
                                        While I was up there I took a lot of the different standards I held for our warehouse and applied them there, the
                                        effects were pretty drastic. I transformed that place from whatever it was before into an actual warehouse.

                                        My incentive to learn is deeply tied in with the problems I face when trying to achieve my goals. My learning process goes like this:
                                        I come up with something I want to do, I try to do it and it fails. I then research a solution and none of the solutions make any sense to me,
                                        I realize that they don't make any sense to me because they are a part of a much larger concept that I do not understand yet.
                                        So I begin to learn that concept to realize I'm still missing a few things I need to know, so I go and learn those things too. 
                                        As long as I have a goal, I'll always have problems, so I'll always be learning

                                       with print statements or a debugger you trace the variable back to where its value was changed to something unexpected, if the value is a 
                                       returning value from a complicated function, you may have to fix that function, or it may be a function that said functions itself uses. 
                                       The rabbit hole can go pretty far, and sometimes its the smallest error that can cause you to lose the most amount of time.

                                        In the world of software development where your coding problems can be logically evaluated, it may seem 
                                        like thats all there is to it, just working through one problem at a time. For some this may be the case, however,
                                        from my experience this is very far from reality. When I design an application, I'm the one who creates the 
                                        coding problems, and each one of these problems can be solved in many different ways that can lead to many more problems
                                        of their own. When you can do something in a thousand different ways, which way is the best way? Each decision you 
                                        make is another commitment down another path that might fail.

                                        There are a few times where I knew how do something but could not commit to acting with it, 
                                        like OOP in Python for example: at one point I knew enough 
                                        to do anything you would usually do with OOP, but I wasn't sure if my knowledge of it was
                                        complete, and was not sure if I understood the purpose of OOP. I had not gone through all my options
                                        and so I could not make a good decision as what I should do.
                                    </p>

                                        If no one or no set of rules are guiding you and you want to get to a place, you need to
                                        get information about every route you can take. You need to reason with that information as to 
                                        what problems you will have to face, as well as the advantages and disadvantages you will
                                        have. There are so many things that need to weighed against each other, and its really hard sometimes 
                                        to get the balance you need, for example: if this one option allows for your application to scale better, 
                                        but costs a week of extra time to do, but you are not sure if your application will grow anymore past 
                                        the limits that you have set, should you do it? If you choose not to and somewhere down the rode your project does
                                        end up growing and you have that same option again, but this time it will take two weeks instead of one, what 
                                        do you decide now?
                                    </p>

                                        Critical thinking comes very natural to me, I'm always weighing all my options against each other because few things 
                                        are obvious to me. I've learned at some point in my life that everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, and the 
                                        best we can do as a society is to put all of our strengths in the right places. I believe that critical thought 
                                        is the engine of software development, and without an engine, I guess your machine will can move if you push it,
                                        but at that point you may have just defeated the purpose of the machine.

                                        I understand that communication skills in software development are vital. So much of the language 
                                        overlaps and it gets very difficult to be specific, and being specific is so important when there is 
                                        such a large variety of different things one can do. When an instruction can mean many different things, elaboration 
                                        becomes critical, and empathy is important as your tool for measuring the effectiveness of that elaboration.

                                        I don't see myself as a strong communicator in every way, I have a weakness when it comes to indirect communication that I cannot
                                        rewind or reread.
                                        With poor working memory it is impossible to digest large chunks of information, and because of that, elaboration cannot be 
                                        reliably dished out to me in something like a lecture. I will ask questions about many of the things I am tasked with
                                        and depending on your style of leadership this may work really well for you or not at all. It can work really well because
                                        It can lead me to becoming closely connected to my leadership, it can also make me follow my instructions with much 
                                        greater precision.

                                        I've learned that if you do not truly understand something then you will have a very limited use for it. For example, if
                                        you were taught that 2 + 2 = 4 and do not know why 2 + 2 = 4, then you will not know that 2 + 2 + 2 = 6. Programming is 
                                        logically driven just like math, however, the syntax of programming comes in many more varieties and each of those variations are 
                                        slightly changing every so often. And its not just the syntax that will change from language to language, the physical changes
                                        made by a similar method in one language can be different in another language. When you understand something objectively 
                                        and the language used to describe that something is
                                        the only thing that changes, its not such a big deal to switch to that other language. The difficulty in learning new languages are not so 
                                        much in the way it describes, but in the way it works. Java Script has a very similar syntax to C language, but using C is a 
                                        very different experience as you are working at a much lower level and many things need to be done manually rather than be 
                                        automatically handled by the language itself.

                                        I'm what people would call "self taught" but I believe that everyone is self taught, our teachers just tell us what 
                                        to learn and help us learn it. For software development, I've had hundreds of different teachers that I've never 
                                        met before, I've never had to ask any of them a question and they have been able to answer my questions anyways.
                                        The internet has not only allowed us to solve each others problems, its allowed us to set those solutions in stone 
                                        so that we don't have to answer the same question twice. This has collectivized teaching in a way to where 
                                        we can all be teachers to each other, and because our work is most of the time practical and can be easily tested:
                                        this has allowed us to grow at a rapid pace. We have connected everyone of ourselves with the possibility of 
                                        expanding both our technological options and technological capabilities in software, and we have the means of 
                                        of keeping up with those advances.

                                        its crucial for minimizing development time after your project goals are met as well. You also have to consider whether or 
                                        not a critical part of your project will actually work when everything is completed.

                                        I've always been someone to put a question to everything I do, especially if I'm investing a lot of my time into it.
                                        When developing something and I've never done anything like that before, its almost impossible to effectively plan anything
                                        because I wont know what to expect. Every project I've built has been a learning experience in the sense that, everything that
                                        I build, I think of how I can build better the next time. With my first programming project, which I was building to help me manage 
                                        our wire cutting process at work, I ended up rebuilding it twice because I had not yet learned how I should structure a software application.
                                        One of the reasons I love developing software is because I love to improve the way I do things and even when it seems like I did everything
                                        perfectly, sometime later I learn something that tells me otherwise.

                                        if I was correcting the error and not making an error myself. Say if one item looks like another item or their names are 
                                        similar, you can make sense of how that sent wrong, but if you don't see something like that, then you have to wonder if you're 
                                        the one who is wrong because you are also fallible.

                                        I already have some experience with C language, although its not nearly enough for 
                                        me to say that I know how the language works. I think learning more about C would give me a 
                                        better understanding of how programming languages work under the hood and would allow me 
                                        more clarity in my decision making when planning my projects.

                                        I've already built something I think might be considered an API, its a flask app that
                                        receives a string, validates that string as Python code relevant to some of its imported
                                        modules and executes that string as code, it then sends back information to be displayed. 
                                        But I'd like to make something more integrated into a programming language that doesn't require 
                                        you to know the syntax of the software you are communicating with.

                                        I'm very interested in building applications that allow a user to work with complex data in an 
                                        easier way, its the purpose in many of the projects I've built so far. In order to expand on these projects
                                        further in regards to ease of access, I would need to know how to use a database.

                                        I'm very interested with how people are coordinated to do this type of work. When for the first time 
                                        I started to understand what I was doing, I thought about how difficult it would be to not only tell
                                        another person else to do it, but a whole team of people. After contributing a few things on github
                                        I have a much better idea of how things are done, but I still haven't worked directly with anyone 
                                        yet and this is for sure one of the most important things for anyone to learn.

                                Above everything else in my life right now, I need to get on a team, whether it be a job with 
                                pay or a small open source dev team that works closely together. I've come this far alone 
                                because programming has been an my obsession, and obsessions are very isolating things
                                for me as they tend to enlarge themselves above everything else, including other
                                people with my same passion. But now that I've cooled off and can see more clearly, 
                                I'm also not as locked on as I want to be and I know thats because no one is depending on me.
