                    <p>I learned I was passionate about coding when my Excel project turned into a 
                    VBA project that kept growing beyond my original ideas that I had set for it. I had no
                    prior training at all when I tried to fix a script that was supposed
                    to take all the cells of a certain color and add them together. None of 
                    the tutorials I found helped me much, I guess they gave me a faded dirt path I could 
                    follow but that was about it. I was jumping into to something that was much bigger than 
                    I could have imagined at the time and there were so many questions that I needed answered
                    that I didn't know needed asking. Obviously I wasnt able to fix the script as I 
                    thought I could so easily do and I ended up going down the hardest path I've ever 
                    followed in my life when I took pieces of that script and ran them in my own sub-procedures to
                    figure out what they did. After writing several hundred lines of code in a single sub-procedure
                    with a ridiculous amount of variables, I learned that I needed to break my code into multiple pieces, 
                    and that arrays existed and I should use them. It was only shortly after that, with my newfound knowledge
                    of the existence of arrays that I built an algorithm that found combinations in the same way that
                    itertools.combinations() would from the Itertools Python package. Of course itertools.combinations() is
                    a generator and I made my algorithm into an ordinary function that returned an array when I figured out that
                    VBA functions could return values, as sub-procedures were functions that didn't return anything.
                    I'm sure it was also nowhere near as efficient or as cleanly written, but it did work for what I needed it
                    for and It didn't lag while doing it. It was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. I honestly 
                    cannot remember how long it took as I obsessed over it so much 
                    I lost track of time. Every day I woke up It was on my
                    mind until I went to sleep and dreamed about it. I can still remember the patterns I would iterate
                    through in my head until I was sure that the pattern I had would give me the correct values. At the 
                    time if I've head the words: "data-structures" and "algorithms" they would not have meant anything to
                    me. I didn't have any knowledge of what I was doing or what it was refered to as, I just knew that I
                    wouldnt be able to calculate what run lengths I should take from what spool If I couldnt compare all
                    those combinations with each other. I also needed somthing to decide what the optimal combination was
                    by many different factors that determined how long the work would take and how much wire was wasted. 
                    I needed to set up a system that moved an array through multiple sub procedures and altered its contents,
                    I needed trim the data to take the workload off the combination function, i needed to orginize the data
                    and display it. I eventually decided I wanted to automate the entire process and that led to even more work,
                    which in the end I decided just wasnt practical and would make the whole application useless. And thats
                    Where I left it and started to learn Python, chasing idea after idea, building a variety of different 
                    applications that have taken me further and further along my path. I've learned so much
                    since that day I completed the combinations algorithm, that day I became a programmer,
                    and I know there will never be a day when I have so much more to learn.
